## üèÅ One Sentence Pitch

A show talking about all the various majors and minors you can have and still be a pre-health student. 

## üî¨ Show Details




- **Title**: KP on the Variety of Pre-Health Majors 
- **Host**: Samikchhya
- **Guest**: Kirsten Peterson our Pre-Health Advisor 

## üìù Show Objectives



- **Objective One**: Introduce how the process of going into medicine works. 
- **Objective Two**: Talk about how there are a variety of majors and minors that can still get you into medicine.
- **Objective Three**: Identify which majors or minors KP would reccomend to be the most helpful for medicine. 

## üìö Sample Questions

- **Question One**: What majors would you reccomend for pre-health? 
- **Question Two**: What are the benefits of going to a private liberal arts for pre-health?
- **Question Three**: What major and minor combinations complement eachother the best for pre-health?

- **Justification for Question One**: Although we know that you can use any major to get into medicine some might be better than others. By asking this question the audience will know what a pre-health advisor would reccomend. 
- **Justification for Question Two**: Because our podcast is from the point of view of Allegehy students and advisors, I think it's important to explain why the education we are receving/giving is a good one for pre-health. 
- **Justification for Question Three**: After picking a major or minor students are usually confused on how to complement one with the other. I think getting the input of an advisor will help them narrow down options. 

## üéâ Show Description

In the beginnig of the episode I would like to start off by introducing the content that I will be talking about while also introducing KP and ask her to talk a bit about what she does as a pre-health advisor. I want monst of the begining to be about just introducing what pre-health is and what it means to be on the pre-health journey at a private liberal arts school. This is where I will ask questions reguarding what being pre-health means, how do you collaborate with your advisor, and what are common majors that people ususlly pick as pre-health students. 

After we start to introduce the common majors that people pick for pre-health, I want to move the conversation to how you can have a variety of majors outside of just the basic sciences and still be a pre-health major. I want to talk about the pro's and con's of deciding to have a unique major. I also want to bring up the question of if KP would reccomend having a differnt major if she belives that something in the sciences would be better. Towrads the end I want to ask/talk about what major and minor combinations she beleves would be best for pre-health and people's future carrers. 

Towards the end of our conversation I want to talk about the how these potential majors/minors can affect students in the future. How useful are they really after collge graduation? Are graduate/medical schools looking for unique majors or do they not care as much? What extracirruculars should students be focusing on to better stand out? Finally I wish to end the show with asking KP to tell the audience what she believes is the single most important peice of advice that all pre-health students should know. 


## üì¢ Call to Action

I want anyone who is considering going on the pre-health route and is unsure about how to get there or what to major in to gain some clarity. There are so many differnt opionins and sources that say so many differnt things that it can be really confusing. I want this episode to be a starting point for incoming students to go to so that they don't have to start their journey confused.
