## Samikchhya Pokhrel

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project.  



**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## 🏁 One Sentence Pitch

A show talking about all the various majors and minors you can have and still be a pre-health student. 

## 🔬 Show Details




- **Title**: KP on the Variety of Pre-Health Majors 
- **Host**: Samikchhya
- **Guest**: Kirsten Peterson our Pre-Health Advisor 

## 📝 Show Objectives



- **Objective One**: Introduce how the process of going into medicine works. 
- **Objective Two**: Talk about how there are a variety of majors and minors that can still get you into medicine.
- **Objective Three**: Identify which majors or minors KP would reccomend to be the most helpful for medicine. 

## 📚 Sample Questions

- **Question One**: What majors would you reccomend for pre-health? 
- **Question Two**: What are the benefits of going to a private liberal arts for pre-health?
- **Question Three**: What major and minor combinations complement eachother the best for pre-health?

- **Justification for Question One**: Although we know that you can use any major to get into medicine some might be better than others. By asking this question the audience will know what a pre-health advisor would reccomend. 
- **Justification for Question Two**: Because our podcast is from the point of view of Allegehy students and advisors, I think it's important to explain why the education we are receving/giving is a good one for pre-health. 
- **Justification for Question Three**: After picking a major or minor students are usually confused on how to complement one with the other. I think getting the input of an advisor will help them narrow down options. 

## 🎉 Show Description

TODO: Write at least three to five paragraphs that describe the content of the
episode, ensuring that the description is both engaging and informative.



## 📢 Call to Action

I want anyone who is considering going on the pre-health route and is unsure about how to get there or what to major in to gain some clarity. There are so many differnt opionins and sources that say so many differnt things that it can be really confusing. I want this episode to be a starting point for incoming students to go to so that they don't have to start their journey confused.
